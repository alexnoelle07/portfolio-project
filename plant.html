    <h3 class="section-title">Project Context</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this project was to research the care practices of plant owners. 
      Accumulating plants inspired the question, "What would be the best wat to care 
      for multiple plants with different requirements?" A study by NASA revealed that 
      keeping plants in the home can eliminate up to 87% of toxins in the air within 
      24 hours. This emphasizes that keeping plants in the home is beneficial for our 
      health and learning how to properly care for plants can promote sustainability.

    <br />
    <h5 class="section-title">Problem Statement</h5>
        <p>In the area of routines and habits, it is suspected that plant owners are over or 
      under watering their plants due to varying watering and environmental requirements. </p>
    <br />
    <h5 class="section-title">Possbile Solution</h5>
        <p>A solution would be to provide an app that matches plants to people based on 
          their lifestyle and living environment.</p>

    <br/><br />
    <h3 class="section-title">Discover Phase</h3>
    <p>It was necessary to conduct interviews to determine if there were common behaviors 
      among plant owners ranging from very experienced to novice. I Interviewed three 
      participants to assess the routines within the range of plant owners. The purpose of 
      the interviews was to get a better understanding of what plant owners find challenging 
      about plant maintenance.</p>

      <br />
      
      <b>Quotes:</b><br/><br />
      ‚ÄúWe put water in it and left it outside for a couple of days and it came back to life.‚Äù <br /><br />
      ‚ÄúI put in Google what is wrong with what I see and what to do.‚Äù <br /><br />
      ‚ÄúIf there was some sort of device or reminder that knew when the plant needed to be watered, 
      it could tell me and then I could water the plant.‚Äù <br /><br />
      <b>Insights From Quotes:</b><br /><br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Users are unable to look for signs of improper plant care.</li>
        <li>Users will take the time to become informed about their plants.</li>
        <li>Users will benefit from getting help with their plant care.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 class="section-title">Define Phase</h3>
    <p>After doing research, I observed that plant owners do not care for plants 
      properly because they uninformed of what each plant needs. This is a problem 
      because each plant may have different care requirements to thrive.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><b>Affinity Map</b><br />
      I collaborated with my cohorts to analyze the responses from the user interviews.<br /><br />

      <br />
    <p><b>Empathy Map</b><br />
      I found subjects with different experiences owning plants to see if I could find 
      any differences between their routines and habits with plant care.<br /><br />

    <br/>
    <p><b>User Story:</b><br/>
      In this story board, the user acquires a new plant. After watering, the user 
      notices that the plant is no longer thriving. The user finds an app to determine 
      the best plant for their lifestyle. The user then gets a new plant based on the 
      recommendations and the app provides information on how to properly care for the 
      plant such as watering reminders and how much light to provide. The user then 
      feels confident enough to purchase more plants.</p><br/>

    <h3 class="section-title">Design Phase</h3>
    <p><b>Wireframing:</b></p><br/>
    <img src="images/wireframe-one.jpg" class="img-fluid deliverable"> <br/> <br/>
    <img src="images/wireframe-two.jpg" class="img-fluid deliverable"> <br/> <br/>
    <img src="images/wireframe-three.jpg" class="img-fluid deliverable"> <br/> <br/>
    <p><b>Prototype:</b><br/>
      I created a prototype design for users to complete a quiz by inputting 
      information about where they live, type of climate, lifestyle habits, etc. The 
      app then presents a list of plants to the user that would best suit their needs 
      and where the user can purchase each recommended plant.
      <br />
      The user can keep a record of all the plants they own as well as information on 
      when each plant needs a specific care action. The user can also build their 
      knowledge base of their own plants and determine which plants would be best for 
      them without using the plant match quiz.</p>

    <br/>
    <h5 class="section-title">Conclusion</h5>
    <p><b>My Insights:</b><br/>My biggest takeaway from this case study was that users are more 
      reliant on searching for information to learn more about their plants. Users are also more 
      likely to look up information about their plants when they are not doing well. The user 
      interview analysis disproved the initial hypothesis. The fact that the users had trouble 
      in maintaining a watering schedule, was a minor paint point.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Future Concepts</b><br/>For future reference, I would like to expand my research to 
      users in other areas and a wider range of ages. It will also be important to consider the
       type of climates a variety of users may live in which would determine how well plants may 
       thrive in a particular type of environment.

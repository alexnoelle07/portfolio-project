        <p class="mb-5">I am a native San Franciscan with a background in education and human development. 
            I have spent 10 years working with children and being a part of
        their growth and development. Through observation of actions and behaviors, I have learned how to create meaningful learning experiences that focuses on the individual children in my care.
         I enjoy working with people and utlizing every connection as a learning experience.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With the pandemic's affect on schools and education, I was able to see a first-hand experience what distance learning
        looked like from the perspective of a child within the early-age range. I saw this as an opportunity to continue my education with a program that would teach me what I needed to help younger children successfully learn core concepts. Upon completing the UX design program with CareerFoundry,
        I have learned valuable skills to bring me closer to connecting user-driven products in education and early childhood development.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My other hobbies include photography and web development. My experience with photography has taught me how to collaborate with my clients and capture the moments that mean the most to them. I love creative outlets and expressing that through many forms. </p>

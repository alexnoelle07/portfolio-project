          <p>The purpose of this project was to research the care practices of plant owners.
            Accumulating plants inspired the question, "What would be the best wat to care
            for multiple plants with different requirements?" A study by NASA revealed that
            keeping plants in the home can eliminate up to 87% of toxins in the air within
            24 hours. This emphasizes that keeping plants in the home is beneficial for our
            health and learning how to properly care for plants can promote sustainability.

          <h5 class="section-title">Problem Statement</h5>
          <p>The Olive app user needs a way to organize and manage their personal and family healthcare accounts. 
            When required to use multiple apps to access and keep track of healthcare information, it becomes 
            complicated for the user to keep track of schedules, costs of visits, insurance claims, and communications 
            with providers. <br/><br/>
          
          We will know this to be true when Olive app users are able to link 2 or more healthcare accounts on one platform 
          and can access tools and personal information across one or more profiles.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5 class="section-title">Possbile Solution</h5>
          <p>A possible solution to this problem will be to create an app that will allow the user to integrate their insurance
          information, medical provider, dental, and vision care. This will give the user access to manage each of their
          healthcare accounts and information in one platform.</p>

          <h5 class="section-title">Design Strategy</h5><br/>
          <p><b>Target Audience:</b> <br/>The target audience for this product is any user who is subscribed to an insurance plan 
            that has separate providers for vision and dental. The user will require all of their medical information on one 
            platform.</p>
            <p><b>Competition:</b> <br />Obvious competitors are other private medical providers such as Kaiser Permanente, 
              MyHealth, MyChart, and Carbon Health. A competitor would be any healthcare provider than offers medical, dental, 
              and vision in one platform.</p>
              <p><b>Risk/Opportunity:</b> <br />A risk to creating this app would be integrating the applications and information from a variety of medical providers.
              There are not many apps that allow syncing, but one example would be TrueBill, a banking app, that syncs the information
              so the user can access it in one application.
              This provides an opportunity to create a more useful medical platform to eliminate using multiple apps for medical,
              vision, dental, and insurance.
              </p>
          <p><b>General Tasks:</b>

          </ul>

          <p>Sutter Health Care provides coordinated care to more than 3 million Californians. It is a not-for-profit organization
          that puts resources back into its communities. Sutter hospitals serve more of the Medi-Cal patient population in
          Northern California than any other health system.*
          With over 12K physicians and 2k advanced practice clinicians, Sutter had over 1.5 million outpatient care visits in the
          last year.

          <p><b></b></p>
          <h3 class="section-title">Define Phase</h3>
          <p>After doing research, I observed that plant owners do not care for plants
            properly because they uninformed of what each plant needs. This is a problem
            because each plant may have different care requirements to thrive.</p>
          <br />
          <p><b>Affinity Map</b><br />
            I collaborated with my cohorts to analyze the responses from the user interviews.<br /><br />
            <img src="images/affinity-map.png" class="img-fluid deliverable">
            <br />
          <p><b>Empathy Map</b><br />
            I found subjects with different experiences owning plants to see if I could find
            any differences between their routines and habits with plant care.<br /><br />

          </p>
          <br />
          <p><b>User Story:</b><br />
            In this story board, the user acquires a new plant. After watering, the user
            notices that the plant is no longer thriving. The user finds an app to determine
            the best plant for their lifestyle. The user then gets a new plant based on the
            recommendations and the app provides information on how to properly care for the
            plant such as watering reminders and how much light to provide. The user then
            feels confident enough to purchase more plants.</p><br />
        
          <h3 class="section-title">Design Phase</h3>
          <p><b>Wireframing:</b></p><br />
          <img src="images/wireframe-one.jpg" class="img-fluid deliverable"> <br /> <br />
          <img src="images/wireframe-two.jpg" class="img-fluid deliverable"> <br /> <br />
          <img src="images/wireframe-three.jpg" class="img-fluid deliverable"> <br /> <br />
          <p><b>Prototype:</b><br />
            I created a prototype design for users to complete a quiz by inputting
            information about where they live, type of climate, lifestyle habits, etc. The
            app then presents a list of plants to the user that would best suit their needs
            and where the user can purchase each recommended plant.
            <br />
            The user can keep a record of all the plants they own as well as information on
            when each plant needs a specific care action. The user can also build their
            knowledge base of their own plants and determine which plants would be best for
            them without using the plant match quiz.

          <br />
          <h5 class="section-title">Conclusion</h5>
          <p><b>My Insights:</b><br />My biggest takeaway from this case study was that users are more
            reliant on searching for information to learn more about their plants. Users are also more
            likely to look up information about their plants when they are not doing well. The user
            interview analysis disproved the initial hypothesis. The fact that the users had trouble
            in maintaining a watering schedule, was a minor paint point.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Future Concepts</b><br />For future reference, I would like to expand my research to
            users in other areas and a wider range of ages. It will also be important to consider the
            type of climates a variety of users may live in which would determine how well plants may
            thrive in a particular type of environment.

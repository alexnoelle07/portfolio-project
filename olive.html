          <p>The purpose of this project was to research the care practices of plant owners.
            Accumulating plants inspired the question, "What would be the best wat to care
            for multiple plants with different requirements?" A study by NASA revealed that
            keeping plants in the home can eliminate up to 87% of toxins in the air within
            24 hours. This emphasizes that keeping plants in the home is beneficial for our
            health and learning how to properly care for plants can promote sustainability.

          <h5 class="section-title">Problem Statement</h5>
          <p>The Olive app user needs a way to organize and manage their personal and family healthcare accounts. 
            When required to use multiple apps to access and keep track of healthcare information, it becomes 
            complicated for the user to keep track of schedules, costs of visits, insurance claims, and communications 
            with providers. <br/><br/>
          
          We will know this to be true when Olive app users are able to link 2 or more healthcare accounts on one platform 
          and can access tools and personal information across one or more profiles.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5 class="section-title">Possbile Solution</h5>
          <p>A possible solution to this problem will be to create an app that will allow the user to integrate their insurance
          information, medical provider, dental, and vision care. This will give the user access to manage each of their
          healthcare accounts and information in one platform.</p>

          <br/> <br/>
          <h5 class="section-title">Design Strategy</h5><br/>
          <p><b>Target Audience:</b> <br/>The target audience for this product is any user who is subscribed to an insurance plan 
            that has separate providers for vision and dental. The user will require all of their medical information on one 
            platform.</p>
            <p><b>Competition:</b> <br />Obvious competitors are other private medical providers such as Kaiser Permanente, 
              MyHealth, MyChart, and Carbon Health. A competitor would be any healthcare provider than offers medical, dental, 
              and vision in one platform.</p>
              <p><b>Risk/Opportunity:</b> <br />A risk to creating this app would be integrating the applications and information from a variety of medical providers.
              There are not many apps that allow syncing, but one example would be TrueBill, a banking app, that syncs the information
              so the user can access it in one application.
              This provides an opportunity to create a more useful medical platform to eliminate using multiple apps for medical,
              vision, dental, and insurance.
              </p>

          <h5 class="section-title">Card Sort</h5><br/>
          <p>For this task, I asked for 5 participants to do a physical and open card sort for the Olive app. The participants sorted
          40 cards into relevant categories.</p>
          <img src="/images/cardsort-one.jpeg" alt="cardsorting" class="img-fluid cardsort"><br/>
          <img src="/images/cardsort-two.jpeg" alt="cardsorting" class="img-fluid cardsort"><br/><br/>
          <p><b>Analysis:</b><br/>
          My initial thoughts on doing a closed card sort was that it would be biased based on where I would intuitively find
          information searching through a healthcare app. The open card sort gave a lot of insight to what topics can be found in
          general categories but other topics could easily placed throughout the application.<br/><br/>
          <img src="/images/collected-data.png" alt="collected data table" class="img-fluid cardsort"><br/>
          100% of participants agreed on the placement for the topics on payments, test results, and messages. 80% of the
          participants had varying thoughts on where to put “settings” and “privacy”. Moving forward, I would like to do more
          research to see if a closed card sort would generalize the placement of topics that are currently spread out.
